**SIGN IN is performed by calling the api route (/signin_user) the it will run the 
function(start_verification) in the api controller (signin_controler) and passing 
the json data in this form : 
{
    "name" : "jack",
        "email" : "example@gmail.com",
        "password" : "abc",
        "phone_num":"12345678"


}

**the function (start_verification) takes the json request and will save the user 
data in a session by calling the function (session_selector) with protocole(put) 
with passing the data with array in form : 
$data = [
            "key" => "user_data",
            "data" => $user_data

        ];
in api controller (Session_controller) under the key (user_data) then it will call 
another function (sendEmail) in the api controller (signin_verification_code) 

**the function (check_code) takes the code given by the user in a json request with 
the form:
{
"code" :"9820"
}
then it calles the session to take the saved verification code with key (very_code)
if they are the same it will call the function store to sign in the user if they are 
deferent it will flush the session data and return error message

**the function (store) is the last step in signing in the function will call the session 
to get the saved user data using the key (user-data) then it saves him in the database
